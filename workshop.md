# DEVWKS-2808 Main Workshop Content

NetDevOps revolves around the concept of being able to automatically deploy, 
and more importantly, validate and verify your changes were successful, and that
the expected outcomes are seen.

In this workshop, weâ€™ll dive deep into the world of Python programming with 
Cisco pyATS/Genie SDK: 

1. establish connection to your devices, issue commands, retrieve response
2. how to represent your testbed devices and its topolgy in YAML
3. parse your device outputs
4. profile your device features
5. and build a full-on script!

## Basic Device Connection

Automation revolves around being able to programmically establish connection
to your testbed devices. There are tools out there today that helps you with
this, eg:

- [Paramiko](http://www.paramiko.org/): Python implementation of SSH client 
- [Pexpect](https://pexpect.readthedocs.io/en/stable/): Python module for 
  spawning child applications (eg, telnet/ssh) and interact with them 
- [Netmiko](https://github.com/ktbyers/netmiko): multi-vendor library that
  simplifies Paramiko SSH connections to network devices 

These libraries are good at establishing low-level connectivity to your devices,
and allows basic device interactions. However, what they do not provide is 
high-level services: stateful handling of various router/switch prompt states, 
and advanced mechanisms such as dialogs prompts, etc.

In pyATS | Genie automation ecosystem, the de-facto device control library
is called [Unicon](https://pubhub.devnetcloud.com/media/pyats-packages/docs/unicon/index.html).

Compared to the solutions above, Unicon provides both low-level connectivity 
APIs, eg `sendline`, `expect`, but also high-level apis such as `execute`, 
`configure`, `ping`, etc, the system dialogs for different platforms can be
automatically handled.

> The example below uses Cisco [DevNet Sandbox](https://developer.cisco.com/site/sandbox/)
> [IOSXE Always-ON testbed](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/38ded1f0-16ce-43f2-8df5-43a40ebf752e?diagramType=Topology).

You can use Unicon directly in your Python interactive shell:

```python
# import connection implementation
from unicon import Connection

# create connection object instance
conn = Connection(hostname = 'csr1000v-1',
                  start = ['ssh developer@ios-xe-mgmt-latest.cisco.com -p 8181'],
                  line_password='C1sco12345',
                  os = 'iosxe')

# start the connection
conn.connect()

# now you can do stuff
conn.execute('show version')
conn.execute('show run | section interface')

# configure stuff
conn.configure('''
interface GigabitEthernet2
   ip address 1.1.1.1 255.255.255.0
   no shutdown
''')

conn.configure('''
interface GigabitEthernet2
   no ip address
   shutdown
''')

# ping an ip
conn.ping('10.10.20.48')

# traceroute an ip
conn.traceroute('10.10.20.48')

```

Notice how the ping and traceroute interfaces are automatically handled for you.

What you have at hand is now a Unicon connection class instance. Each instance,
depending on the specified OS, supports various different services.

- Connection Documentation: https://pubhub.devnetcloud.com/media/pyats-packages/docs/unicon/user_guide/connection.html
- Supported Platforms: https://pubhub.devnetcloud.com/media/pyats-packages/docs/unicon/user_guide/introduction.html#supported-platforms
- Services per OS: https://pubhub.devnetcloud.com/media/pyats-packages/docs/unicon/user_guide/services/index.html

Under Unicon connection framework, the core handles boilerplate connection
details such as spawning child processes, send/receive/expect output, etc. Per
platform support is achieved through platform plugins, under:

```bash
    # note - * represents your python version.
    $VIRTUAL_ENV/lib/python*/site-packages/unicon/plugins/
```

Each platform plugin contains information such as:

- expected command prompt for each state of the device (eg, enable, configure)
- various service implementations (eg, `reload()`)

There is no hard-coded information for Cisco-only platforms - everything is a
plugin. This means you can adjust the behavior for your target platform, or, 
implement your own platform plugin for other vendors.

## Using Mock Devices

For ease of training purposes, the rest of this training session
no longer require access to real testbed devices - a mock device is included. 

To use the mock device, in the workspace folder, source the testbed environment
file.

```bash
. env/testbed
```

This will set the necessary virtual environment variables to use mocks devices.

**Limitations**:
- one-use: each time you connect to the device, the inter counters are reset and
  you can issue the commands only once. To repeatedly use the same mocks, 
  re-launch your python process/script.

- no configuration/states: the mocks are good for show commands - does not
  handle configuration changes

To get out of using mocks, close this shell window, or

```bash
. env/unset
```

Note that if you have your own testbed devices, you can modify the testbed YAML
files accordingly and proceed without mocks, using your own devices.


## Defining a Testbed YAML File

Unicon connection class is a portable way to get into a single device. 
However, when it comes to real networks, often there is an array of devices that
are interconnected, and much more information that describes each device. This
is where testbed file comes in.

A testbed file is a [YAML](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html) syntax file that
describes your devices and their inter-connectivity. It is the basis of almost
all pyATS | Genie based automation.

> YAML is designed to be a white-space sensitive, human-readable data 
> representation/serialization language.

**A Very Simple Testbed YAML File**

```yaml
devices:                                # section describing your devices
    csr1000v-1:                             # device hostname -> used for matching prompt in Unicon
        type: router                        # switch | router
        os: iosxe                           # os -> used to determine Unicon connection plugin to load
        connections:                            # section describing all device connections
            console:                                # console connection block
                protocol: telnet
                ip: 172.25.192.90
                port: 17001
```

> File copy available at [files/simple-testbed.yaml](files/simple-testbed.yaml).

To check whether your newly defined testbed YAML file is syntactically correct,
you can check its content using the `pyats validate testbed <file>` command.

```bash

pyats validate testbed files/simple-testbed.yaml
# Loading testbed file: files/simple-testbed.yaml
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Testbed Name:
#     simple-testbed
#
# Testbed Devices:
# .
# `-- csr1000v-1 [router/iosxe]
#
# Warning Messages
# ----------------
#  - Device 'csr1000v-1' missing 'platform' definition
#  - Device 'csr1000v-1' has no interface definitions
#
# YAML Lint Messages
# ------------------
```

Let's now load this testbed file in Python, and, like above, initiate 
connection to our device and do some fun stuff.

```python
from pyats.topology import loader

# load the testbed file
testbed = loader.load('files/simple-testbed.yaml')

# let's see our testbed devices
testbed.devices
# TopologyDict({'csr1000v-1': <Device csr1000v-1 at 0x10cd0a3c8>})

# get the device we are interested in
csr = testbed.devices['csr1000v-1']

# connect and run commands
csr.connect()
csr.execute('show interface')
```

Now let's expand our concept - throw in a slightly bigger testbed yaml file.

```yaml
testbed:
    name: CLUS-19-DevWks-2808

devices:
    nx-osv-1:
        type: switch
        os: nos
        alias: 'uut'
        tacacs:
            login_prompt: "login:"
            password_prompt: "Password:"
            username: "admin"
        passwords:
            tacacs: Cisc0123
            enable: admin
            line: admin
        connections:
            console:
                protocol: telnet
                ip: "172.25.192.90"
                port: 17028
    
    csr1000v-1:
        type: router
        os: iosxe
        alias: helper
        tacacs:
            login_prompt: 'login:'
            password_prompt: 'Password:'
            username: cisco
        passwords:
            tacacs: cisco
            enable: cisco
            line: cisco
        connections:
            console:
              protocol: telnet
              ip: 172.25.192.90
              port: 17002
```

We can now connect to each testbed device individually.

```python
from pyats.topology import loader

# load the testbed file
testbed = loader.load('two-device-testbed.yaml')

# because we assigned aliases to each device, we can refer by alias instead
nx = testbed.devices['uut']
csr = testbed.devices['helper']

# connect and run commands
for device in [nx, csr]:
    device.connect()
    device.execute('show version')
```

It is possible to specify multiple methods of connecting to your devices. Eg:

```yaml

devices:
    csr1000v-1:
        type: router
        os: iosxe
        connections:
            console:
                protocol: telnet
                ip: 172.25.192.90
                port: 17001
            mgmt:
                protocol: ssh
                ip: 10.1.3.50
```

You can specify which connection desciption to use, as `via`:

```python
# assuming you followed the above example and:
#   1. loaded the testbed
#   2. assigned csr device to 'csr' variable.

# connect to mgmt 
csr.connect(via = 'mgmt')
```

## Parsing Device Outputs

Now that you have connectivity to your devices, let's do something more fun.

NetDevOps and automation is based on being able to programmatically make 
decisions on your network device states. To do that, we need to first "convert"
device output into something more "Pythonic" - using parsers.

pyATS | Genie comes with over 1000 parsers. You can access the list of all 
available parsers at https://pubhub.devnetcloud.com/media/pyats-packages/docs/genie/genie_libs/#/parsers.

To use these parsers, first, load your testbed yaml file.

```python
from genie.testbed import load

testbed = load('files/testbed.yaml')
uut = testbed.devices['uut']
uut.connect()
```

Wait wait wait - what's this `genie testbed`? Were we not using pyATS testbeds 
just a few moments ago?!

We were. But let's clarify. 
- pyATS is the foundation - it comes with all the generic framework skeleton
- Genie is the network automation library framework on top. 

Genie naturally extends pyATS's objects and models, and features ready-to-use 
libraries, such as parsers. What you saw above is a core representation of
how pyATS works and models things. However - for all intents and purposes for
NetDevOps and network automation, we'll be focusing on Genie.

**So am I using Genie or pyATS?**

*Both*. Genie extends pyATS - so whenever you are using Genie, you *are* using
pyATS.

How let's get back to our exercise. Notice that everytime we go into shell, 
we have to import the testbed loader and load the yaml file. There's must be a
better way.

```bash
# launch python interactive shell, and load teh testbed yaml file
genie shell --testbed-file files/testbed.yaml
# Welcome to Genie Interactive Shell
# ==================================
# Python 3.6.5 (default, Jun 27 2018, 10:39:16)
# [GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 10.0.0 (clang-1000.10.25.5)]

# >>> from genie.testbed import load
# >>> testbed = load('testbed.yaml')
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# >>>
```

Now the testbed is loaded automatically for you, and available as the `testbed`
variable for you to use in this interfactive shell

Because we are using Genie, extending the core pyATS functionality, once we
connect to testbed devices, we can do... more!

```python
# get our device
uut = testbed.devices['uut']

# connect to it
uut.connect()

# leverage parsers - a Genie functionality!
# (note - make sure to use full commands)
uut.parse('show version')

# save it to variable
intfs = uut.parse('show interface')

```

This invokes the [show interface parser](https://pubhub.devnetcloud.com/media/pyats-packages/docs/genie/genie_libs/#/parsers/show%20interface). Remember that Genie libraries are open
source? You can view the source code [here](https://github.com/CiscoTestAutomation/genieparser/blob/master/src/genie/libs/parser/nxos/show_interface.py#L145).

In Genie parser library, all parsers returns dictionaries. These return 
dictionaries are described by its own schema, giving you an indication of
what the parser will return. 

Following this schema, now let's check for our interface's information

```python
intfs.keys()

# reach into the structure and get something interesting
intfs['Ethernet2/1']['enabled']

import pprint
pprint.pprint(intfs['Ethernet2/1']['counters'])
```

Can you think of... the things you can do now, with this?


## Profile Device Features

What you have now is awesome. But we're still dealing with single CLIs. How can
we step back, get a bigger picture in view, and look at an entire feature?

While we ponder about that, let's step back a bit. Even if we were just parsing
show commands - show commands are particular to each platform. Even for just
interfaces, you'll notice that

- for IOSXE, the command is `show interfaces`
- for NXOS, the command is `show interface`

This means our script above isn't portable...

[Genie models](https://pubhub.devnetcloud.com/media/pyats-packages/docs/genie/genie_libs/#/models) to the rescue!

Genie models are YANG-inspired Python classes that implements a whole 
feature/protocol agnostically. Theyâ€™re called YANG-inspired because the 
development team studies the YANG models of various platforms and crafted 
their own. Why? Because YANG is a machine-to-machine descriptor, and NETCONF 
XML comes with its own angle bracket taxâ€¦

Built to be human-friendly and engineered to works across different platforms 
and OSes, Genie models enables users to interact with network devices/protocols
in a holistic, high-level and Pythonic fashion. 

```python

# get our device
uut = testbed.devices['uut']

# connect to it
uut.connect()

# let's learn a whole model instead
bgp = uut.learn('bgp')

# now let's look at what we learnt
import pprint
pprint.pprint(bgp.info)

# what if we could... track the number of neighbors we have?
num_nbr = 0

for bgp_instance in bgp.info['instance'].values():
    for vrf in bgp_instance['vrf'].values():
        for nbr in vrf['neighbor'].values():
            if nbr['session_state'] =='established':
                num_nbr += 1
```

Because Genie models are agnostic across different platforms, you can write a 
piece of code once, and port it across different devices.


## Putting It All Together

Now let's put everything we've learnt and write a useful script together. For
this script, we'll make it interesting and for each connected device, do the
following:

- display hostname
- display software version and hardware information
- print a table of all interfaces and their CRC error counter
- print the # of BGP neighbors they have

For this script, because we want to print a nice table, let's make use of an
awesome PyPI package called [tabulate](https://bitbucket.org/astanin/python-tabulate/src/master/)

```bash
# install tabulate as a dependency
pip install tabulate
```

```python

from tabulate import tabulate
from genie.testbed import load

testbed = load('testbed.yaml')

for device in testbed:
    device.connect()
    device_info = device.learn('platform')
    bgp = device.learn('bgp')

    # print useful information
    print('\n' + '-'*80)
    print('Hostname: %s' % device.name)
    print('Software Version: %s %s\n' % (device_info.os, device_info.version))
    
    nbr_info = []
    for bgp_instance in bgp.info['instance']:
        for vrf in bgp.info['instance'][bgp_instance]['vrf']:
            for nbr in bgp.info['instance'][bgp_instance]['vrf'][vrf]['neighbor']:
                state = bgp.info['instance'][bgp_instance]['vrf'][vrf]['neighbor'][nbr]['session_state']
                nbr_info.append((bgp_instance, vrf, nbr, state))
    
    print(tabulate(nbr_info, headers = ['BGP Instance', 'VRF', 'Neighbor', 'State']))

    active_nbr = len([i for i in nbr_info if i[-1].lower() == 'established'])
    print('\nTotal # of Active Neighbors: %s' % active_nbr)
    print('-'*80 + '\n')

```
